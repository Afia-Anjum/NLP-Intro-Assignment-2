Place the assignment-2.py file in the directory which contains the train, dev and test directories. Each of these directories' name must end with the suffixes "_train", "_dev" and "_test", respectively.

The program requires one of the following three arguments to function correctly, --unsmoothed, --laplace or --interpolation, specifying the type of model that will generate the output files.

The program will then prompt the user for an input specifying whether files in the dev set or test set are being tested. Input the character 't' for test set or 'd' for dev set.

For example, a successful running of the program with laplace smoothing for a directory containing test files by the name of '*_test' (* can be anything else) will yield the following on terminal:

	>Afia-MacBook-Pro:A2 Afia$ python assignment-2.py --unsmoothed
	Are you testing for test or dev files? Enter t for test, d for dev.
	t
	Output generated successfully! Please check your current working directory for the output .txt file.
	>Afia-MacBook-Pro:A2 Afia$ 

As indicated, the output file will be generated in the same directory as the assignment-2.py file.
